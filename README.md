## Swift student challenge
I developed this app to partecipate to the Swift Student Challenge, driven by a deep-seated passion for cooking and a desire to blend technology with culinary creativity. Through Italicious, I aim to share the joy of Italian flavors and inspire others to explore the rich culinary heritage of Italy.
